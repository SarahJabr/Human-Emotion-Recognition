# Human-Emotion-Recognition

## Introduction
Three different CNN models trained using three different datasets to recognize emotions based on facial expressions.
In this project, we propose three image classification models using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize emotions in images. The models are trained on three different datasets of different sizes and types (31000 RGB images, 35000 Grayscale images and 1000 Grayscale images), each labeled with one of seven different emotions. The CNN architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation and horizontal flip are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's performance. The models are trained and evaluated on the datasets, achieving high accuracy on the validation set. These models can be further applied to various real-world applications such as emotion recognition in human-computer interaction and emotional analysis in a variety of science fields.
